# Iteration 3 Feedback

*Grader: Sam - marqu317@umn.edu*

This file contains the feedback for some components of your iteration 3. If you have questions or concerns, please reach out to me (Sam) and we can resolve them.

Note: This file contains the final code submission as one section and the Bug Report, CPP lint, Doxygen, and submission elements as another section.

## Bug Report, Cpplint, Doxygen, and Submission Structure (25% of iteration 3)

This is scoring for the requirements of iteration 3 for having a bug report, having no Cpplint errors, updated doxygen documentation, and structuring your turned in work correctly. Overall, these components add up to 25% of your total iteration 3 grade.



| **Category**                                  | **Score** | **Comments** |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Bug Report | 5 / 5 |  |
| CppLint - No Errors | 5 / 5 |  |
| Doxygen Updated | 10 / 10 | woah lots of documentation. It's well written. Now here's a word of warning for the real world: too much documentation can be a bad thing. If someone changes the code, the corresponding documentation needs to be changed. This is very hard to guarentee often. Even if someone is changing the documentation, it can slow down the speed at which a program is produces by a significant amount of time. It's all about balancing the right amount of documentation :) |

## Code (30 % of iteration 3)

This section corresponds to the requirement of having fully functional code for the requirements of iteration 2. As such, the same rubric is used. I've started by looking at your feedback for iteration 2, and then reviewing locations I marked off points. Please note that this section is worth 30% of the total points for iteration 3.
